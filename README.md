# ControllingBuggyUsingDCmotor

In this project I have tried to control a Buggy using two DC motors and input is given using Serial monitor.
input 1 in serial monitor                  -->    buggy will move backward (Both DC motors will rotate anticlockwise)
input 2 in serial monitor                  -->    buggy will move forward  (Both DC motors will rotate Clockwise)
input 3 in serial monitor                  -->    buggy will move right    (One DC motor will rotate Clockwise other one will remain still)
input 4 in serial monitor                  -->    buggy will move left     (One DC motor will rotate Clockwise other one will remain still)
input other than 1,2,3,4 in serial monitor -->    buggy will move stop     (Both DC motors will remain still)
